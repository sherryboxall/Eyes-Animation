## Description
This project demonstrates the ability to use Javascript create web styles.

### How to Run
This will run locally in your browser from index.html if you download all files and ensure they're located in the same directory as each other and have the same file structure  


### Planned Future Improvements
Try to program eyes so that pupils move opposite directions (left eye counter clockwise). Make eyes blink when pupils cross
